Product size measurement allows for errors of 1-2cm (0.39-0.79 inches). 2. Due to the light and screen difference, the item's color may be slightly different from the picture. 3.Commodity origin: At present, the hand-made model factories on the earth are basically established in China. After foreign brands are developed, they will be produced and processed in China, so the products will be printed with the words ""made in china"" or ""made in China"". But don't worry, folks, all genuine products will be shipped to the market after strict quality inspection by the developer. 4.Regarding the difference between genuine and pirated versions: Although both the genuine hand-made models and the pirated products are from Chinese factories, they are not comparable in quality. However, since the quality inspection of hand-made polishing and coloring is done manually, it is inevitable that there will be defects.

It was thriving as a town for merchants and townspeople. As industrialization progressed after the Meiji era (1868-1912), Osaka became the center of industry, and a rich culture and arts flourished.Some characteristics of Osaka Gadan are:Bunjin-ga (or literati painting):&nbsp;Literati artists like Kimura Kenkado or Okada Beisanjin were active beside their professions as townspeople.Realistic painting followed Maruyama-Shijo School:&nbsp;Nishiyama Hoen and Kan'ei, Fukada Chokujo, Niwayama Koen are famous.Outstanding activities of women painters:&nbsp;Hoshika Yukino, Becchaku Tsukino, Hashimoto Hanano and Shii Hoshino are famous. They studied under Kitano Tsunetomi, known as the father of bijin-ga of Osaka Gadan. Shima Seien is also a charismatic figure selected for the Bunten Exhibition at the young age of 20.In recent years, Osaka Gadan has been re-evaluated around the world. Some of recent exhibitions held in Japan are:""Salon Culture and the Pictorial Arts of Kyoto and Osaka"" (The National Museum of Modern Art, Kyoto 2022)""Japanese Paintings of Modern Osaka"" (Nakanoshima Museum of Art, Osaka 2023)""Osaka in the Eyes of Women Painters"" (Nakanoshima Museum of Art, Osaka 2023-2024)In April this year, we also held an exhibition titled ""The Beautiful World of Artists in Osaka - Pursued in Taisho Period- (2024)"" with the cooperation of Seki Kazuo, a big collector of Osaka Gadan artists. The exhibition included works that had been missing for many years and were welcomed as new discoveries.This item is the one introduced at the exhibition.We hope you can find the excitement directed towards Osaka Gadan.*We do our best in writing the description and judging paintings.

Born Karel Cerny in Prague in 1892, he arrived in France in 1913 to continue his studies and joined the army for the duration of the war. He exhibited at the Salon des Artistes Indépendants from 1913, then at the Salon de la SNDA between 1930 and 1939 and at the Salon d'Automne between 22 and 32. His paintings of still lifes with models of old boats earned him the title of painter of the navy in 1952.",https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQwNlgxNjAw/z/Er0AAOSwartmiD3p/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F,"[""https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTQwNlgxNjAw/z/Er0AAOSwartmiD3p/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F"", ""https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTMzNVgxNjAw/z/LKEAAOSwpqBmiD3o/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F"", ""https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjEy/z/8moAAOSwoLFmiD3n/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F"", ""https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE5NlgxNjAw/z/r~8AAOSweMVmiD3o/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F"", ""https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDM0/z/1bIAAOSwcVRmiD3m/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F"", ""https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE4NlgxNjAw/z/i7wAAOSweKtmiD3q/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F"", ""https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI4MVgxNjAw/z/JB4AAOSwTjtmiD3s/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F"", ""https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDYy/z/0~QAAOSwgRNmiD3u/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F"", ""https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAzM1gxNjAw/z/shMAAOSwJXRmiD3v/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F"", ""https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI4MlgxNjAw/z/LK0AAOSwpqBmiD3x/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F"", ""https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE4MVgxNjAw/z/EMYAAOSwUXFmiD3w/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F"", ""https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTM3NlgxNjAw/z/DdwAAOSwDLtmiD3x/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F"", ""https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/X6UAAOSwlE5miD3n/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F"", ""https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/SrcAAOSwmdtmiD3c/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F"", ""https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/ydMAAOSwUc5miD3d/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F"", ""https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/73AAAOSwz6hmiD3c/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F"", ""https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDgwWDY0MA==/z/g2EAAOSwTP5miD3c/$_57.JPG?set_id=880000500F""]",551,Art:Paintings,"{""Artist"": ""Charles Cerny"", ""Unit of Sale"": ""Single Piece"", ""Signed By"": ""Charles Cerny"", ""Size"": ""Medium"", ""Signed"": ""Yes"", ""Period"": ""Mid Century"", ""Material"": ""Canvas"", ""Item Length"": ""21"", ""Region of Origin"": ""France"", ""Framing"": ""Framed"", ""Subject"": ""Still Life"", ""Type"": ""Painting"", ""Year of Production"": ""1958"", ""Original/Licensed Reproduction"": ""Original"", ""Item Height"": ""5 in"", ""Style"": ""Modernism, Impressionism, Still Life, Surrealism"", ""Theme"": ""Art, Nautical, Portrait"", ""Features"": ""One of a Kind (OOAK)"", ""Production Technique"": ""Oil Painting"", ""Country/Region of Manufacture"": ""France"", ""Culture"": ""French Impressionist"", ""Handmade"": ""Yes"", ""Item Width"": ""18"", ""Time Period Produced"": ""1950-1959""}"
